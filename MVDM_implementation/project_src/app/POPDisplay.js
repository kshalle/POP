Make a Display object, and a number of functions that operate on it.
 One of the functions accepts an array of visual element objects as
 input, and turns those visual elements into a render tree.

So, from top level, can have case where zoom in and pan, and end up with
 pieces of syntax that have no direct relation to each other, and there
 is no path to navigate the graph from one portion to the other, without
 going up into nodes that are wholly outside the view window
Need something that represents the full, raw, browser window that this
 is all being rendered into.
So, pass in an object that repr the window, with a number of children, one
 child for each segment
When set up this window-object, find the most ancestral view set of each
 segment and make that one of the children of the window.

Q: possible to encounter case where navigate to a child via links, and 
 then that child has a second parent?  Or some other way end up with a 
 child, that has a link to a parent that hasn't been rendered yet?

Assumptions:
Assuming not possible for child to have an un-rendered parent, for now..
 (keep an eye towards making it straight forward to add that case later)
Assuming no forsest case for now, there's only one connected 
 sub-graph
Assuming caller finds an ancestor of whole sub-graph, whose bounding box
 visually contains all drawn shapes and all bounding boxes

Will eventually have to handle these cases in order to get zoom and pan
 to work!  (Just want to get basic functionality working, for now)

/*
A POP container is an organizing element used during rendering.
 It holds an absolute position on the screen, as well as an absolute
 size on the screen.  It inherits an accumaled scaling factor that
 is the product of all the scaling factors of its ancestors.
Hence, visual shapes can be stated in terms of their natural sizes,
 and then each one is given a local scale factor, only relative to a
 parent, within that parent's container.  So, the final absolute
 shape size, within the top-level window, is calculated by
 first applying the local scaling, to get it to the right size 
 within its parent container, and then applying the parent's
 accumulated scaling, to get it to the right size on the screen.

 is transient and recomputed every time the window is rendered!

/*
renderRootViewSet causes the Display to render all the view sets reachable,
 and treat them all as descendants contained
 inside the bounding box of the root view set. (Caller of this method
 must ensure that within all the view sets reachable from the root, that
 the root has the outer most bounding box.)

A view set is linked to other view sets.  Each link marks which is the parent
 and which is the child, and also carries the position and relative scaling
 applied to the child within the context of the parent.  The position assumes
 that the parent is the root, and the scaling is set such that the child
 container fits within the bounding box allocated to it within the parent.
Note that the parent view set is normally a syntactic-element that has a
 number of input-boxes around it.  Each of these input boxes has a size
 that is in absolute pixels, and a position.  The syntactic element also has
 a bounding box, which bounds the element's shape and all of the input
 boxes.  If that element's bounding box is drawn full size as the root of
 the display, then the input box is drawn with its stated size and 
 absolute position.
Now, the input box is normally not drawn (only drawn if it is empty). 
 Rather, that input is linked to a child view-set.  That entire view set
 is scaled such that its bounding box fits inside the input box, and the
 child view set's origin is shifted to the x, y position of the input box.
The link between the view sets carries the scaling factor and the x and y
 offset of child (x and y within the parent's bounding box, treating upper
 left of bounding box as 0,0)
Note that all rendering is done directly to the root SVG element.  Hence:
 -] when the child is drawn, it must first be scaled in the same way as the
  parent was scaled, and then scaled again by the amount in the link. Both
  these scalings are applied to the size of the child's bounding box.
 -] The real position of the child is the real position of the parent plus
  the offset of the child within the parent (carried in the link), but the 
  offset is only scaled by the scaling applied to the parent.  
 -] The child has its own children, who treat it as a parent.  The 
  grandchildren will see the child as a parent, and will use the scaling
  factor in the child.  That factor is the scaling factor in the parent
  multiplied by the scaling factor in the link. 

For Root View Set do this: 
-] Make a container for the view set, which acts as a root container.
- -] use the transforms passed along with root view set to shift and size it
- -] add container to the view set.
- -] The container width and height are scaled according to transforms 
- -] It's real x,y, and imposed scaling are calc'd according to transforms
-] Call the function that renders the view tree of a view set.
-] Call the recursive function that walks the view-set graph, visiting 
   the connected view-sets.

So, starting with root view set, assume that it is the top level view set,
 and so not the child of any others (not always true!  Fix later).
 Assume the view-set graph is formed such that a given view set is
 the child of at most one other view set.
Start recursion..  this fn processes one view-set
 Mark the current (passed in as parameter) view set as "visited this round"

/* render view tree of a view set
Render to the window all the shapes from one view tree from one view-set

Descend the tree of view boxes breadth-first.  If view box has children
 then make a container for the view box.  
A container has a real x,y and an inherited scale factor.
The view box has an x offset and a y offset, and a local scale within
 its parent view box's bounding box.
So, to calculate the container values, take the parent view box's 
 offset, multiply by the parent container's imposed scaling, to get
 real offset of view box within the parent.  Add these to the parent
 container's real X and real Y, to get the child container's real x,y.
Likewise, the child container's bounding box is calculated.  Start with
 the view box's width and height, multiply those by the local scale to
 get size within parent container, then multiply by parent container's
 imposed scaling, to get final real width and height.
Finally, child container's imposed scaling is the product of local
 scaling factor times parent container's imposed scaling factor.

If view box has a shape, then calculate the real position and the final
 svg-performed scaling to be applied to the shape.
To calc position, 
-] take the view box's x,y, which is relative to the view box's parent's
 bounding box.
-] multiply by the parent container's imposed scaling factor, to get
   real offset from the parent's origin.
-] add these values to parent container's real x, y to get shape's
   real x, y
To calc scaling factor to attach to svg elem:
-] take view box's local scaling and multiply by parent container's
   scaling factor, to yield the scaling factor attached to svg elem

NOTE: doing minimal effort implementation, which will recompute all
	  every time the window is rendered (no memory of containers
