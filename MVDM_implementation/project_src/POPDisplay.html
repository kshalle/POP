		<!--This page is a Display for a POP system.  Eventually, a user
			will simply open this page in their browser, and it will
			load whatever the last view was for that user.  The user will
			then enter gestures and get responses in the form of new things
			drawn on the display.  For example, they can open worksheets
			or view srcHolder contents, in either syntactic form or syntax
			graph form.  And they can manipulate the environment, such as
			make tunnels to other systems, create persistent processors, 
			expand the running processors made from a particular code
			base (IE, the POP equivalent of running a program) and so on.
			
			For now, this page starts up the entire POP system, but in the
			future it will simply connect to an existing, persistent one.-->
