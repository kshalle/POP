POP
===

This repository contains the code for the Pattern Oriented Programming (POP)
system.

As of the time of creation of this repo, this is mainly the javascript 
implementation of the Model-Vizualizer-Display-Modifier (MVDM) pattern by
which POP code is edited (IE entered, stored, viewed, modified).

Eventually the system of persistent processors (the POP equivalent of a 
"program run") and worksheets for creating and interacting with them will be 
viewable and editable via this MVDM implementation as well.  This will, in 
effect, act as an OS abstraction layer over the top of native OSes, and allow a 
distributed system of persistent processors that exist across machines to be 
interacted with and managed from any browser.

For now, this repo contains a bunch of things related to the MVDM development,
such as learning exercises for javascript, the DOM, famo.us, three.js, D3, and
so on.

It also contains the evolving MVDM code, which is driven by an example
syntax graph (the GabePattern example)

At the time you read this, there may have been significant changes..  READMEs
tend to get forgotten  ;-)
